# Nashville CocoaHeads Presentation for October 2017

### Topic:
Exploring Swift on the Server

### Description:
This month we will explore the relatively new world of creating Swift server applications. The idea of being able to write back ends in Swift is appealing to iOS/Mac developers for obvious reasons but there might be some other benefits you might not be aware of! Come out as Addison Webb gives an overview of the current landscape of frameworks and tools for creating Swift server applications, and demonstrates the power of using Swift on the server.
