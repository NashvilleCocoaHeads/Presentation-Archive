# Nashville CocoaHeads Presentation for March 2017

### Topic:
RIP Parse?

### Description:
Remember Parse.com? Parse made it super simple to setup a backend and get started developing your app. Parse.com shut down in late January, but before the shutdown, Facebook open sourced the main components so developers could transfer their apps to their own servers.

This month Addison Webb will provide an overview of the [Parse Server](http://parseplatform.org) open source project and demonstrate how to setup a parse server.
