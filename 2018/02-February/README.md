# Nashville CocoaHeads Presentation for February 2018

### Topic:
Swift Codables

### Description:
This month Blake Merryman shows off how easy it is to use Swift's new data encoding & decoding APIs. Using Swift's Codable, we will easily take data from an external source (like JSON from a webservice) to a type in our app to persisting on disk. We'll also talk about a few gotchas and advanced use-cases.

[Check out our fork of the source code here.](https://github.com/NashvilleCocoaHeads/SWAPI)
