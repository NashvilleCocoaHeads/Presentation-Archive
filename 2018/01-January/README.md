# Nashville CocoaHeads Presentation for January 2018

### Topic:
Building a Data Structure in Swift

### Description:
Learn about Swift data structures as we build our own from scratch! We’ll explore language features such as associated types and protocol extensions that will help us along the way. We’ll also touch on building and testing the project on Linux. By the end, we’ll have created a new data structure you may find useful in any of your Swift projects.
