### Topic:
Speed 4: Overclocked - Performance Tuning for iOS

### Description:
We ask a lot of our iPhones these days, and while they're wicked fast, sometimes you just need more speed! Come hear how to use the Instruments app to identify and fix performance bottlenecks in your apps. We'll go over the tooling, dig into some misguided implementations, and cover some best practices for performance tuning.
